        I was introduced to web development in 2019, When I clicked the "F12" key by mistake (That's where a saw the console).... That was the first time I saw code and I was Interested form the start. I started learning HTML in late 2019 When Lockdown was ongoing and I had nothing to do, so I downloaded the 'Docs' and went on till today. Software Development started as a hobby, but become a Passion later on and in mid 2021 when I was in Grade 10, I started building WEBSITE for local businesses
