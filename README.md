# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here youâ€™ll find a collection of my projects and skills. 

## About Me

As a Full Stack Developer, I possess an impressive arsenal of skills in HTML, SASS/SCSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, React Native, Next.js, Express.js and MangoDB. I excel in designing and maintaining responsive websites that offer a smooth user experience. My expertise lies in crafting dynamic, engaging interfaces and APIs through writing clean and optimized code and utilizing cutting-edge development tools and techniques. I am also a team player who thrives in collaboration with cross-functional teams to produce outstanding web applications

I was introduced to web development in 2019, When I clicked the "F12" key by mistake (That's where a saw the console).... That was the first time I saw code and I was Interested form the start. I started learning HTML in late 2019 When Lockdown was ongoing and I had nothing to do, so I downloaded the 'Docs' and went on till today. Software Development started as a hobby, but become a Passion later on and in mid 2021 when I was in Grade 10, I started building WEBSITE for local businesses
